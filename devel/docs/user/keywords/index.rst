Custom KW
---------

The keyword CUSTOM_KW enables custom data key:value pairs to be stored in ERT storage.
Custom KW has many similarities to Gen KW and Gen Data but is fully defined by the user and contain only key_value pairs.

You define a Custom KW in your config like this::

    CUSTOM_KW GROUP_NAME <input_file>

GROUP_NAME
    This is similar to Gen KW where every keyword is prefixed with the GROUP_NAME like this: GROUP_NAME:KEYWORD

input_file
    This is the input file expected to be generated by a forward model.

For example::

    CUSTOM_KW COMPOSITION composition.txt

With this setup ERT will expect the file composition.txt to be present in the runpath.
This file may look like this::

    oil 0.5
    water 0.2
    gas 0.2
    unknown 0.1
    state good

Every key-value pair must be a string followed by a space and a value.
The value can either be a number or a string (all numbers are interpreted as floats).

After a successful run, ERT will store the COMPOSITION Custom KW in its filesystem and will be available for every realization.
An export will present the values produced as:

* COMPOSITION:oil
* COMPOSITION:water
* COMPOSITION:gas
* COMPOSITION:unknown
* COMPOSITION:state
